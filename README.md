# Computer-Science-11
A repo to store all my work for my Computer Science 11 course

All files will have a header with project info like this:

```

# Created [DATE]
# Last modified [DATE]
# [PROJECT DESCRIPTION]
```

Projects will be stored in seperate folders with their own README for ease of use

Repo will be publicly available for ease of access
